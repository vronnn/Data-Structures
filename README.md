# Data Structures

## Description : 
This repository is my journey studying data structures and their implementation in C and C++ programming languages ​​during college. it contains a fast review and it's source code file within the same folder for each data structure. There are also some practices that i've done from HackerRank and it's solutions in **Practice** folder. But since i'm still learning about this subject, feel free to correct me if i'm wrong, thanks :thumbsup:  

## Content :
- Binary Search Tree &rarr; BST's explanation and implementation
- C Explicit Containers &rarr; C implementation of C++ STL containers 
- C++ Standard Template Library &rarr; Explanations and each container's implementation
- Practice &rarr; solving data structure's category problems
- Self Balancing BST &rarr; Explanation, comparison, and implementation of AVL & Red-Black Tree


## How to Access :
You can directly run all of these source code files in a C/C++ IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Dev-C++, CodeBlocks, etc. Or you can run it in a code editor such as visual studio code (vscode) but with C/C++ compiler installed in your computer/laptop first.
